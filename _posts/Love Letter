Thinking that it will be us <br>
Just the both of us <br>
I couldnâ€™t be more happy <br>
Knowing that I will do that with my best friend <br> 
And to think that before I didn't appreciate you at your true value <br>
and to say that I didn't take care of you as I should <br>
and to say that I gave to others more than to you <br>
you were not my priority <br>
Now I look at you and I'm proud <br>
we come from afar <br>
you didn't let me down <br>
You believed in me when no one else did <br>
When no one else was there you were always there <br>
Even if it was to scoop me up with a spoon <br>
 or to give me tough love <br>
you are the only one I can count on <br>
they come and go <br>
but only you remain <br>
and when I look at you<br>
 I'm happy to do the adventure with you <br>
I couldn't have fallen better<br>
