It was that fleeting hour of day when the moon and sun are high and bright at the same time. <br>
Like many things in my life, these summer nights wouldn't last much longer.<br>
I sat quietly on a chair, thinking about you. <br>
I couldn't believe that you just left me. <br>
Was it me? Am I the reason that every good things in my life leave? <br>
Do I make you take your legs in your strike?<br>
Yet everything seemed to work like clockwork to me.We were liking a romance.<br>
We took that beautiful bungalow near the beach. You really liked the decoration and even made a joke about running away here forever. <br>
We had such an amazing night making out. We talked for hours while taking a walk. We watched the sunset together and marveled a it's beauty. <br>
Your smile was so beautiful, I couldn't stop staring at you. But now, it's all gone. <br>
Now, you are just a memory.<br>
You are a part of my life that no longer exist. <br>
I can't get you back even if I tried. I just have to let you go..<br>
Let you go as the trees let their leaves fall when autumn comes.<br>
I didn't give up on you, don't get me wrong.<br>
I'm realizing that our happily ever after wasn't meant to be and it's break my heart.<br>
Watch over me from above...<br>
