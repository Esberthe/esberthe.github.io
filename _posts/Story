It was fleeting hour of day when the moon and sun are high and bright at the same time. Like many things in my life, these summer nights wouldn't last much longer.
I sat quietly on a chair, thinking about you. I couldn't believe that you just left me. Was it me? Am I the reason that every good things in my life leave? 
Do I make you take your legs in your strike? Yet everything seemed to work like clockwork to me.We were liking a romance.
We took that beautiful bungalow near the beach. You really liked the decoration and even made a joke about running away here forever. 
We had such an amazing night making out. We talked for hours while taking a walk. We watched the sunset together and marveled a it's beauty. 
Your smile was so beautiful, I couldn't stop staring at you. But now, it's all gone. 
You are a memory. You are a part of my life that no longer exist. I can't get you back even if I tried. I just have to let you go..
Let you go as the trees let their leaves fall when autumn comes. I didn't give up on you, don't get me wrong.
I'm starting to realize that over happily ever after wasn't meant to be and it's beak my heart.
Watch over me from above.
