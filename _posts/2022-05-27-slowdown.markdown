<p>Baby girl, I’m begging you <br>
Slowdown and take a deep breath <br>
Life is not a race<br>
The first place won’t get an award <br>
You’re going at your own rhythm <br>
On your own condition <br>
Cause you’re not competing with anyone <br>
Make sure you’re moving, that’s all<br>
Limp, climb, crawl, walk, or run if that’s what you want <br></p>

<p> Baby girl, calm down <br> 
yes, your acquaintance from school <br>
will seems doing good <br>
and will apparently accomplish more things than you did <br>
That’s fine <br>
Be truly happy for them <br>
Cause you’re not competing with anyone <br>
Make sure you’re moving, that’s all<br>
Limp, climb, crawl, walk, or run if that’s what you want <br></p>

<p> Baby girl, relax <br>
Just because you didn’t get there yet by <br>
Whatever deadline you fixed or the society pressure on you<br>
Doesn’t mean you failed <br>
I know you’ve been craving for a win <br>
To show them that you can too <br>
But you’re not competing with anyone, baby girl<br>
Make sure you’re moving, that’s all<br>
Limp, climb, crawl, walk, or run if that’s what you want <br></p>

<p> Baby girl, slowdown <br>
You want everything, now <br>
You want the glory<br>
Slowdown and smell the failures <br>
 they have something to teach you as well<br>
Like the weeds <br>
They can teach you about persistence<br>
Baby girl, enjoy the thorns as you would the flowers<br></p>
