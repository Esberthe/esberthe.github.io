I’m not accommodating pain.<br>
A few months ago, I was diagnosed with AVN. Basically, my left hip bone is dying.
Which makes me limp when the pain is at a certain level. I’m used to pain because of my medical condition, but this one hit differently. 
I can’t tie my boots. 
If I drop something on the floor, it’ll be more likely stay there or I have to use different stratagems to take it without having to duck. 
That’s how bad is it and I didn’t even explain the sitting part, trying to lay on my bed or even getting dressed or undressed. Anyway. </p>

<p> Today, I wanted to buy firm footwear for events that I’m planning to attend this year.
I was thinking flat shoes because I felt like it will be more comfortable and will accommodate my daily pain.
I went to that store with my friend. We saw those classy, giving boss lady vibes heels and I try them on.
I walked, danced with them and even though it wasn’t what I walk-in to buy. 
I was happy with my purchase cause I’m not planning to accommodate the pain, because you’ll not be staying in my body for a long time. 
So yes, to all the pleasures that I used to get, yes to the heels, yes to go back to the gym, yes to living my life as I want.
Pain will be accommodated in this house. </p>

<p>  P.S: In case you’re wondering, yes, I’m seeing a doctor for that. <br></p>
