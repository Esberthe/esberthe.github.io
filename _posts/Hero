I don’t need a hero <br>
Being me is already heroic <br>
I don’t need one <br>
Cause I don’t need a savior <br>
I’m able to save myself<br>
I don’t need a hero <br>
because I've got me<br>
I’m the only one <br>
Who can comfort me after a failure  <br>
I’m the one <br>
Who will always be there for me <br> 
I don’t need a hero<br>
Cause when I’ll be crying at night<br>
When my tears will drown me<br>
Me and myself will get that <br>
When I will question my existence<br>
When I will be in pain <br>
calling for death<br>
no one can do anything about it<br>
I don’t need a hero <br>
Cause no one can save me from me <br>
I must be my hero<br>
because apart from me no one else is up to it<br>
